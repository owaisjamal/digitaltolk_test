Do at least ONE of the following tasks: refactor is mandatory. Write tests is optional, will be good bonus to see it. 
Please do not invest more than 2-4 hours on this.
Upload your results to a Github repo, for easier sharing and reviewing.

Thank you and good luck!



Code to refactor
=================
1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php
2) app/Repository/BookingRepository.php

Code to write tests (optional)
=====================
3) App/Helpers/TeHelper.php method willExpireAt
4) App/Repository/UserRepository.php, method createOrUpdate


----------------------------

What I expect in your repo:

X. A readme with:   Your thoughts about the code. What makes it amazing code. Or what makes it ok code. Or what makes it terrible code. How would you have done it. Thoughts on formatting, structure, logic.. The more details that you can provide about the code (what's terrible about it or/and what is good about it) the easier for us to assess your coding style, mentality etc

And 

Y.  Refactor it if you feel it needs refactoring. The more love you put into it. The easier for us to asses your thoughts, code principles etc


IMPORTANT: Make two commits. First commit with original code. Second with your refactor so we can easily trace changes. 


NB: you do not need to set up the code on local and make the web app run. It will not run as its not a complete web app. This is purely to assess you thoughts about code, formatting, logic etc


===== So expected output is a GitHub link with either =====

1. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored code 
OR
2. Readme described above (point X above) + refactored core + a unit test of the code that we have sent

Thank you!


Solution:
==========

The code appears to be functional, but there are areas for improvement. Here are some of my observations:

BookingController.php:
----------------------

Positive Aspects:
===================

Dependency Injection: The use of dependency injection in the constructor for the BookingRepository is a good practice, promoting code flexibility and testability.
Controller Methods: Methods seem to be well-organized and have clear responsibilities.


Areas of Improvement:
=======================

Magic Values: The code uses several magic values like env('ADMIN_ROLE_ID') and env('SUPERADMIN_ROLE_ID'). Consider using constants or configuration files to make these values more manageable.
Conditional Complexity: The index method has conditional logic that can be a bit complex to follow. Consider refactoring it for better readability.
Hard-coded Values: There are hard-coded values like 'Record updated!' and 'Push sent'. Consider using constants or configuration for these messages.
Lack of Comments: Some methods lack comments explaining their purpose and logic.

Readability and Code Organization:
==================================

Consider breaking down the large method sendNotificationTranslator into smaller, more focused methods. Each method should have a single responsibility.
Use meaningful variable names to enhance code readability. For example, replace variable names like $oneUser with more descriptive names.

Dependency Injection:
======================

Consider using dependency injection for the services/classes needed in the controller, instead of creating new instances inside the methods. This makes the code more testable and flexible.

Logging:
=========

Instead of creating a new Logger instance inside the method, inject the logger as a dependency or use Laravel's built-in logging facilities.

Conditional Logic:
==================

Simplify nested conditional logic by breaking it into smaller functions. This makes it easier to understand and maintain.

Magic Values:
=============

Replace magic values like '2', '1', 'yes', and 'no' with constants or enumerations for better readability and maintainability.

Notification Sending:
=======================

Consider encapsulating the logic for sending push notifications and SMS in separate classes or services. This promotes better separation of concerns.

Additional Notes:
===================

I've replaced magic values with config values where applicable.
Created separate methods for updating distance and job details to improve readability and maintainability.
Used null coalescing operator (??) for handling default values.
Improved method names for better understanding.
Remember to adjust the constants and method names based on your actual configurations and business logic.


BookingRepository.php:
-----------------------


Code Organization:
===================

The code is organized into a class and methods, which is good. However, it seems to have some duplicated logic in different methods.
The constructor of the class (__construct method) contains the initialization of the logger. It might be better to initialize this logger in a separate method if it's not always needed.

Readability:
=============

Some variable names could be more descriptive. For example, $cuser could be named more explicitly.
Magic values like 'yes', 'no', and 15 are scattered throughout the code. Consider using constants or configuration values to make the code more readable and maintainable.

Validation and Error Handling:
==============================

Validation and error handling could be improved. There are blocks of code checking for conditions and returning specific responses, but a more unified and consistent approach might be beneficial.

Dependency Injection:
=====================

Dependency injection is used for the Job model and MailerInterface, which is good. However, the AppMailer class is instantiated directly within methods. Consider injecting it through the constructor or using Laravel's service container.


Reuse Existing Models:
======================

Instead of directly using database queries, leverage Laravel's Eloquent models for better abstraction and maintainability.

Avoid Complex Logic:
====================

Refactor complex logic into separate methods with descriptive names. This helps in understanding the purpose of each piece of code.

Comments:
=========

Add comments to explain the purpose of the methods and any complex logic.

Error Handling:
=================

Implement proper error handling mechanisms, such as try-catch blocks, and provide meaningful error messages.

Documentation:
==============

Include PHPDoc comments for methods to provide clear documentation on their parameters and return types.

Consider having a peer review to get additional insights and suggestions for improvement.

Comments:
=========

There are some comments explaining what certain sections of code do, but adding more comments, especially for complex logic or non-obvious decisions, would be beneficial.
